**Description**  
This assignment required adding primitives including rectangles, circles, lines, polygons, and paths using D3 SVGs. I chose to add these elements by recreating the basic structure of the painting "Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper. I used rectangles and polygons for many of the large structures in the painting (e.g. rectangles for the windows across the street, polygons for the walls of the restaurant). I added lines to connect the walls of the restaurant together. For the "WOO" on the sign above the restaurant, I used a path for the W and two circles for the Os. I also added a lightswitch on the inside wall of the restaurant that, when clicked, "turns off" the lights.
![Nighthawks Lights Off](nighthawks_off.png)

When you click the lightswitch again, it turns the lights back on.
![Nighthawks Lights On](nighthawks_on.png)


**Technical achievements**  
Adding a function that turns the lights on and off.

**Design achievements**  
Recreating "Nighthawks" using layering of elements and hexcodes to get colors close to original painting.
